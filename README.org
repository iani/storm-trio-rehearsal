Libraries for sonifying geomagetic measurement data on SuperCollider and visualizing them on openFrameworks. 

* Installation on SuperCollider

- Make a symbolic link to the folder =./sc/DataSendLibrary/= to the Extensions folder in your Platform's user app dir 

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
Platform.userExtensionDir
#+END_SRC

- Edit the file =startup.sc= in your =Platform.userAppSupportDir=.  Insert this line to make the library load the data when you start up SuperCollider or when you recompile the sclang library:

#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
StormData.loadData;
#+END_SRC
